# Overview

It's important that all aspects of SplashKit are thoroughly tested. This is especially important because
SplashKit is designed to be used by beginners - they should be able to focus on learning to develop
software and fix bugs in their own code rather than wondering why some aspect of the framework isn't
functioning as expected. Unit tests allow us to efficiently test and validate the core functionality of SplashKit.

# Goals

Currently, unit testing isn't given much of a spotlight in documentation, and developing and running tests is more
cumbersome than it could be. So, goals for unit testing are:

- Research ways of improving unit testing workflow, including integration into Visual Studio Code, which is the 
IDE recommended in SplashKit documentation
- Create documentation for unit testing, including an onboarding guide for those wanting to write and run unit tests
