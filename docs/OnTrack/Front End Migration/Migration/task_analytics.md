# OnTrack Component Review

## Component Name
Analytics Configuration (virtual page views)

### Files in this Component
analytics.coffee (to be removed)

## Description

The analytics.coffee file was previously responsible for configuring Google Analytics tracking in the AngularJS version of the application. Its key functionality included disabling automatic route change tracking by setting ``` $analyticsProvider.virtualPageviews(false) ```, preventing virtual pageviews from being recorded.

## Why Removal is Required

It is no longer functional due to the migration to Angular 17.

All analytics functionality has been migrated to Google Analytics 4 (GA4), which is fully managed through gtag.js in index.html.

Virtual pageviews and event tracking are now handled explicitly using Angularâ€™s Router and manual event tracking with gtag().


# How Has This Been Tested?

Monitoring Network Activity (Before and After Removing analytics.coffee): there is no change in the network activity ( Browser developer tools-> network tab-> filter the keyword "google"), before and after removing analytics.coffee since tracking is now fully handled by gtag.js in index.html.

Modifying virtualPageviews to True/False : No visible change in pageview tracking behavior, indicating that analytics.coffee is no longer controlling analytics.
